ARIA-tools has various methods for stitching the unwrapped phase layer. One of these methods leverages a third-party package called “RelaxIV” which is distributed within the Min-Cost-Flow-Class. Users wanting to use RelaxIV, need to agree to the RelaxIV license agreement (different than ARIA-tools) at https://github.com/frangio68/Min-Cost-Flow-Class.git. Users that have accepted the RelaxIV license can use it in combination with ARIA-tools by cloning the Min-Cost-Flow-Class github repository in the “thirdParty”. Compilation of the RelaxIV code is handled through the setup.py program provided with ARIA-tools, which will check for existence of the "Min-Cost-Flow-Class" folder during its build and install step.
